       How angular implementing data-binding ?
       
       
       
       while creating ng-application
      
      
       compilation-phase:
       
       for every model property in scope(s) , angular will register 'watch expression'(s) to do
       data-binding. ( View  <====> ViewModel )
       
       
       we can also register our own 'watch expression' in scope object to mionitor
       model changes to execute custom-logic.
       
       ----------
       
       all watch expressions are executed by 'digest-loop' if model is dirty.
